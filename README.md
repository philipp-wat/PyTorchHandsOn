# PyTorchHandsOn

Simple pytorch project to get an hands-on. First blacken parts of a photo and use the original photo as a label. With deep learning it should be possible to restore the complete photo. Uses Tensorbaord and tests the model at random picutres. For reasons of simplification, only using validation and training split.
